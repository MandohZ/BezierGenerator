This file contains a python script that uses numpy and matplotlib to generate a quadratic b√©zier curve. 
The three control points can be adjusted to create the desired shape. The control point coordinates can be extended outside the plot. 
The smoothness of the curve can be controlled by adjusting np.linspace.
